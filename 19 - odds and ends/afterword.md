# The Chances are a Million to One

When [@5DN1L](https://www.codingame.com/profile/bbb8f47ea4601179303c20acdbf5fb6c1904782) first suggested I do an Algorithm X playground, the first thought that ran through my head was, “I do not want to do that.” The second thought I had was, “Even if I did want to do it, the chances of me actually doing it are a million to one.” 

Notice I said a “million to one”. I did not say a “million to zero”. And, what does the word “one” mean? It means, there’s still a chance.
