Algorithm X Complexity: Strap in and hold on tight!

# Strategy

This might be the toughest Algorithm X puzzle on Codingame. Using the techniques covered so far, you can solve most of the test cases. However, Test Case 8: Advanced and Test Case 13: Expert are just too big to solve purely with backtracking. A little later in the playground, I will cover problem-space reduction, and I’ll revisit this puzzle with a few more ideas that might help you find the finish line.

Let’s first talk about Test Cases 1 through 7, 9 and 10. They can all be solved with Algorithm X by following the processes covered in the Mrs. Knuth puzzles, but it will not be easy.

Lot’s of challenging multiplicity.


Algorithm X will generate multiple solutions for Test Cases 11 and 12 and you will need to determine which solution has a __single connected group__ of nodes.



Backtracking is guessing. Using only logic, no backtracking at all, you can solve 1 – 8 and 10.

Only a combination of pre-backtracking logic and Algorithm X can solve all the test cases.
