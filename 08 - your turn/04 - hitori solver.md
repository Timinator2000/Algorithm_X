# Strategy

My solution for Hitori Solver is surprisingly similar to Mrs. Knuth â€“ Part III. The goal statement is extremely short:

*Each puzzle consists of a square grid with numbers appearing in all squares. The object is to shade squares so:
    *No number appears in a row or column more than once.
    *Shaded squares do not touch each other vertically or horizontally.
    *When completed, all un-shaded squares create a single continuous area.
