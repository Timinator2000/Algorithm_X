# Problem Statement

Harmless Rooks is a hard puzzle, but a very short Algorithm X setup can easily solve the first two test cases and get you moving in a powerful direction. Although the Algorithm X setup is not terriblycomplex, some background is helpful. For convenience, I have copied the entire goal statement here:

> The __rook__ is a chess piece that can move along its current line (horizontally) or column (vertically) through any number of free (unoccupied) squares.
>
>In this problem, we consider an N Ã— N generalized chess board where the squares are either free (. in the input) or already occupied (X in the input) and hence cannot be crossed by the rooks.
>
>Compute the __maximum number of rooks__ that can be placed on __free squares__ in such a way that __no two rooks threaten each other__ (hence two rooks on the same line/column must be separated by at least one occupied square).
