No reducing at all - still solve 1, 2 & 3 very fast. Test cases 2 and 3 generate a pretty good handful of solutions before a solution is met that meets the requirements. 30 and 78. ME requirements are critical. Without them, you will probably not pass Test case 3.

To be fast on all test cases requires good reducing + me_requirements.
