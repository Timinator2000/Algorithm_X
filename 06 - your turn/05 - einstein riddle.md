# Strategy

Einstein’s Riddle Solver lends itself perfectly to the tiles on a gameboard analogy. Even the problem statement directs you to…

>solve the riddle and print it as a grid, separated by space and newline, with each person in their own column and each characteristic category on its own line.

And what are the tiles? They are the characteristics, of course. Your job is to place all the tiles on the grid. I am sure that sounds familiar.

In Sudoku, some cells are prefilled and I suggested handling that by limiting the actions available for those cells to a single action, putting the correct number tile on each prefilled grid position. This puzzle has essentially prefilled the entire first row:

>The characteristics in the first line will be ordered alphabetically…

You can choose to put any characteristic in any column, as long as you obey the rules. The examples given in the problem statement are:

>1. Georges & Salad which means Georges eats Salad
>
>1. Georges ! Salad which means Georges doesn't eat Salad.

#2 is very clear. You cannot put salad in the same column as Georges! Sounds like mutual exclusivity, right? But what about #1. How can we handle mutual inclusivity, actions that _must_ happen together?

Assume I have a set of options: `{a, b, c, d, e}` and it is given that `a` and `c` are mutually inclusive. I have to choose two options from the set, but if I choose `a`, I must also choose `c` or if I first choose `c`, I must also choose `a`. Any combination of `b`, `d` and `e` would be fine. In this playground, we have only covered mutual exclusivity, never inclusivity. Is there a way we can handle this situation with what we already know? There sure is!

If `a` and `c` must be chosen together, I could shift my perspective and say:

* `a` _must not_ be chosen with `b`
* `a` _must not_ be chosen with `d`
* `a` _must not_ be chosen with `e`
* `c` _must not_ be chosen with `b`
* `c` _must not_ be chosen with `d`
* `c` _must not_ be chosen with `e`

The only options left are to choose both `a` and `c` or to choose some combination of  `b`, `d` and `e`.

If Georges must have Salad, you can accomplish that by making sure Georges cannot have any of the other food options and Salad cannot go with anybody except Georges. [Later in the playground](einsteins-riddle-solver-2), I will discuss another way to handle mutual inclusivity, but changing the mutually inclusive requirement to a set of mutually exclusive requirements is an easy and often effective solution that works wonderfully on Einstein's various riddles.
