# The School Scavenger Hunt

To explore implementation options for all-or-none sets of events, consider the following scenario. You must divide a group of 18 children into 3 teams of 6 for the elementary school scavenger hunt. To make things fair for the younger kids, each team will have one child from each grade. Fortunately, you have a very accommodating distribution of ages:

| Grade | Names |
|:-----:|:--------|
|1|Wednesday Addams<br>Maggie Simpson<br>Michelle Tanner|
|2|Brenda Walsh<br>Arnold Jackson<br>Arthur Fonzarelli|
|3|Stephanie Tanner<br>Darlene Conner<br>Carlton Banks|
|4|Willis Jackson<br>Pugsley Addams<br>Marcia Brady|
|5|Greg Brady<br>Lisa Simpson<br>Joanie Cunningham|
|6|Richie Cunningham<br>Bart Simpson<br>D. J. Tanner|

Each child will be assigned to either the red, the green or the blue team. To help the parents during drop-off and pickup, it is important that siblings be assigned to the same team. All siblings share identical last names.

This year, the 2nd grade students will be team captains. Brenda Walsh is the red team captain, Arnold Jackson is the green team captain and Arthur Fonzarelli is the blue team captain.

# All-or-None Sets

Grouping the children by last name results in the following all-or-none sets of names:

* Bart Simpson, Maggie Simpson, Lisa Simpson
* D. J. Tanner, Michelle Tanner, Stephanie Tanner
* Wednesday Addams, Pugsley Addams
* Richie Cunningham, Joanie Cunningham
* Willis Jackson, Arnold Jackson
* Marcia Brady, Greg Brady
* Brenda Walsh
* Arthur Fonzarelli
* Darlene Conner
* Carlton Banks
