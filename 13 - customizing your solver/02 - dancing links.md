# `DLXCell`

My `AlgorithmXSolver` DLX implementation is based on [@Robostack]'s 








```
class DLXCell:
    def __init__(self, title=None):
        self.prev_x = self
        self.next_x = self
        self.prev_y = self
        self.next_y = self

        self.col_header = None
        self.row_header = None

        # Only used for column and row headers.
        self.title = title

        # Size quickly identifies how many rows are in any particular column.
        self.size = 0
```
