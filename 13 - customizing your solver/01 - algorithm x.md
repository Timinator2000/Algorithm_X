# Algorithm X

To have a conversation about customizing Algorithm X, it is necessary to first understand how Algorithm X works. You are welcome to study a detailed discussion in [Knuthâ€™s The Art of Computer Programming](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html) or a well-done summary on [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X). There is little benefit to me repeating that material here.

In the next graphic, I have copied the algorithm provided on Wikipedia which came from Knuth. I strongly recommend you work your way through the step-by-step Algorithm X example provided on Wikipedia to gain an understanding of how Algorithm X processes the matrix rows and columns to find solutions.

# Long Pause

As I move forward with customization options, I will assume you have a reasonable idea how the above algorithm works. I am sure you noticed you can solve a lot of exact cover problems without understanding the details of the algorithm, but if you want to do any customization, you will need a basic understanding of the internal Algorithm X mechanics. I must admit, I went through the example on Wikipedia more times than I can count as I worked my way through the various exact cover puzzles. Take as much time as you need!

# What Can Be Customized?

Looking at the algorithm above, Step 2 and Step 3 both involve making a choice. In Step 2, a column is chosen from all yet-to-be-covered columns in the matrix. Once a column is chosen, Step 3 loops through all rows that cover that column and those rows are chosen in some order. In certain situations, __especially when the matrix is large__, these choices can make a meaningful difference.

# ALWAYS TRY THIS FIRST

You do have some influence over how rows and columns are chosen simply by how you set up the matrix. In the absence of detailed instruction, `AlgorithmXSolver` will choose colummns from left to right and rows from top to bottom. In the `AlgorithmXSolver` constructor, the matrix is contructed left-to-right and top-to-bottom to mirror the order in which you built the requirements list and the actions dictionary.

`AlgorithmXSolver` does not have any detailed instructions for ordering rows, so top-to-bottom is the default. Columns are a bit different. By default `AlgorithmXSolver` will always choose the column that is covered by the fewest number of rows. This is referred to as Minimum Remaining Value or MRV. But, what about ties? What if several columns have the same MRV? In what order are those columns tried? `AlgorithmXSolver` breaks ties from left to right.

Being careful about how you build your requirements list and your actions dictionary __is always the easiest way to influence the ordering of choices__ in Steps 2 and 3. It is also the most efficient way to handle sorting of choices as the matrix is built in the order you desire and sorting need only be considered one time.

# Dynamic Sorting

In rare cases, you might wish to customize the sorting or rows and columns on some criteria that can change as the 

Before I cover how to customize each of these selection processes, we must first have a short discussion about [Dancing Links (DLX)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links) and the DLX implementation used in `AlgorithmXSolver`.
