# Algorithm X

In order to have a conversation about customizing Algorithm X, it is necessary to first understand how Algorithm X works. You are welcome to study a detailed discussion in [Knuthâ€™s The Art of Computer Programming] or a well-done summary on [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X), but I do not see benefit in me trying to repeat that material here.

In the next graphic, I have copied the algorithm provided on Wikipedia. I strongly recommend you work your way through the step-by-step Algorithm X example provided on Wikipedia to gain an understanding of how Algorithm X processes the rows and columns to find solutions.
